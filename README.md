# ECON-8210-Computational-Methods-in-Economics-Replication

This project contains replication of a simplified version of the model from Fourakis, Karabarbounis (2024) created for ECON 8210 Computational Methods in Economics course:
1. Matlab codes
2. PDF file with explaination of the approach taken and results obtained

## Files
| File Name                 | Description                              |

| `CovidSpread.m`           | Matlab code which solves the model and produces figures. |
| `tauchen.m`               | Matlab function which uses Tauchen method to discretize an AR(1) process (adapted version of analogous Julia code from QuantEcon). |
| `Elk_CovidSprRepl.pdf`    | PDF file which contains description of the approach taken in each problem and results obtained. |
